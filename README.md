# Smolcode

An agentic experiment: take the [smallest possible coding agent](https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent), and ask it to modify itself.

What will you get?

Smolcode is my attempt at finding out.

# Usage

The `smolcode` CLI can be invoked in several ways:

1.  **Default Mode (Interactive Coding Agent)**:
    Run `./smolcode` without any subcommands to start the interactive coding agent.
    *   `-c, --conversation <path>`: Optional. Path to a JSON file to initialize the conversation from a previous session.
    *   `-m, --model <model-name>`: Optional. The name of the model to use (e.g., `gemini-1.5-pro-latest`).
    *   `--mcp <id:command>`: Optional. Register an MCP (Anthropic's Model Context Protocol) server. This flag can be used multiple times to register multiple servers. The `<id>` is a unique identifier for the server, and `<command>` is the command to execute to run this MCP server. For example: `./smolcode --mcp my-server:./run_my_server.sh`

2.  **Plan Management**:
    Manage development plans using the `plan` subcommand.
    *   `./smolcode plan new <plan-name>`: Creates a new, empty plan file.
    *   `./smolcode plan inspect <plan-name>`: Displays the plan in Markdown format.
    *   `./smolcode plan next-step <plan-name>`: Displays the next incomplete step of the plan.
    *   `./smolcode plan set <plan-name> <step-id> <status>`: Sets the status of a step. `<status>` can be `DONE` or `TODO`.
    *   `./smolcode plan add-step <plan-name> <step-id> <description> [acceptance-criteria...]`: Adds a new step to the end of the plan. Acceptance criteria are optional.
    *   `./smolcode plan list`: Lists all available plans, showing their status and task counts.
    *   `./smolcode plan reorder <plan-name> <step-id1> [step-id2 ...]`: Reorders steps within a plan. Specified step IDs are moved to the front in the given order; others follow.
    *   `./smolcode plan compact`: Removes all completed plans from storage.
    *   `./smolcode plan remove <plan-name-1> [plan-name-2 ...]`: Removes one or more specified plans from storage.

3.  **Memory Management**:
    Manage the agent's knowledge base using the `memory` subcommand.
    *   `./smolcode memory add <id> <content>`: Adds or updates a memory entry with the given ID and content.
    *   `./smolcode memory get <id>`: Retrieves and displays a memory entry by its ID.
    *   `./smolcode memory search <query>`: Searches memories by a query string and displays matching entries.
    *   `./smolcode memory forget <id>`: Removes a memory entry by its ID.
    *   `./smolcode memory test`: Runs a built-in test to verify memory functionality (add, get, forget). This command will also build the `smolcode` executable.

4.  **Conversation History Management**:
    Manage conversation history using the `history` subcommand.
    *   `./smolcode history new`: Creates a new conversation and saves it.
    *   `./smolcode history append --id <conversation-id> --payload <message-payload>`: Appends a message to an existing conversation.
    *   `./smolcode history list`: Lists all saved conversations with their details.
    *   `./smolcode history show --id <conversation-id>`: Shows the detailed messages of a specific conversation.

# Configuration

This section details the necessary environment variables and files used by `smolcode`.

## Environment Variables

Based on the current analysis, `smolcode` itself does not directly require specific environment variables to be set for its core operation. However, the tools it interacts with, particularly the Google Gemini API, will require appropriate authentication.

*   `GEMINI_API_KEY`: Your API key for Google Gemini. This is required for the agent to communicate with the language model.
*   `SHELL`: Specifies the shell to be used when executing commands. Used by the `run_command` tool.
*   `INCEPTION_API_KEY`: Your API key for the Inception service. Used by the `generate_code` tool.

_(If other environment variables are identified as directly used by `smolcode` in the future, they will be listed here.)_

## `.smolcode` Directory

The `.smolcode` directory in the root of the project stores operational data for the agent. Here's a breakdown of its contents:

| Filename/Directory      | Purpose                                                                                                                               |
| :---------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `history.db`            | Database file for storing conversation history or interaction logs.                                                                   |
| `last-working-version`  | Stores a reference or copy of the last known good state, potentially for rollback or recovery.                                        |
| `memory.db`             | Primary database for the agent's memory, including facts and learned lessons (likely an indexed or structured form of `facts/`).      |
| `plans.db`              | Database storing development plans, including their steps and statuses.                                                                 |
| `system.md`             | Contains the system prompt, core instructions, or initial configuration for the `smolcode` agent.                                     |

# How it works

It's really simple:

- all context is provided in full to the model,
- smolcode offers a growing set of tools,
- we see where the tool calls take us.

Currently smolcode works directly with the Google genai API using `gemini-2.5-pro-05-25`.

# Rules of the game

All changes are made by the agent itself.

All commits are done by the agent itself.

Only when the agent is broken am I allowed to touch code/files.

# Q&A

## Where should I start reading?

1. First, read this blog post: <https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent> â€“ this agent is based on that
2. Then start reading [agent.go](./agent.go), it contains the meat of the implementation
3. Finally check out individual tools that pique your interest. All tools are implemented in files starting with `tool_`.

## How can I try it out?

Make sure you have your Gemini API key ready.

Then:

```
export GEMINI_API_KEY=add-your-key-here
go build -tags fts5 ./cmd/smolcode
./smolcode
```

If you need fancy line editing:

```
rlwrap ./smolcode
```

The system prompt is read from [smolcode.md](./smolcode.md)
